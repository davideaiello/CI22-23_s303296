## Project
We have used a Dijkstra optimized approach.
Every state is a subset of the indeces of the list of lists ( problem(N) ), to avoid memory overflow.
Every state has a cost, that it is the number of repetitions of the numbers of that subset of lists, divided by the total length of that subset
